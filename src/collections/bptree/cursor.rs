         * Let's talk about the magic of this function. Come, join

         *
         * This function is the heart and soul of a copy on write
         * structure - as we progress to the leaf location where we
         * wish to perform an alteration, we clone (if required) all
         * nodes on the path. This way an abort (rollback) of the
         * commit simply is to drop the cursor, where the "new"
         * cloned values are only referenced. To commit, we only need
         * to replace the tree root in the parent structures as
         * the cloned path must by definition include the root, and
         * will contain references to nodes that did not need cloning,
         * thus keeping them alive.
         *
         * To achieve this, there are some possible states we have to account.
         * - the root is the leaf
         * - the root is a branch with arbitrary branch nodes until leaf
         *
         * We must, effectively handle these situtations.
         *
         * As we are having to clone the path, this means we need access to
         * the previous node *and* the next node. Why? Because if we need
         * to clone the next node, we must update the value pointer to our
         * node in the previous node to keep the cloned path consistent.
         *
         * This is why we need to consider the root is leaf situation - there
         * is no previous node!
